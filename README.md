# DiviApp

Money-splitting app using **React-Native** and **Redux**

_Future releases coming_ ðŸš€

## The project

DiviApp was born as practice to test my JavaScript programming capabilities, but ended being my first pet project, meaning that **I'm not thinking about letting the current release be the last one!**

## How to run the project

If you're here, I'm assuming you know your way around the basics of JavaScript and you have Git, NodeJS and a code editor (VSC recommended) on your PC. If you don't, here are videos you can watch to solve that:

- [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFwejIsHlY)
- [NodeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1US-P13yKVs)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlIzFUI1QGA)

To run this proyect properly, you need an Android (or iOS) emulator, like [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (if your PC doesn't have the requirements to run that, I recommend [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/)). Also, you should install MongoDB on your PC. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwMwO8pXfq0) you can learn how to do that.

### First Step

1. Clone the repo:

```js
git clone https://github.com/martinc1991/diviapp-rn.git
```

2. Next, install dependencies:

```js
// in the root folder of the project
npm i
```

By now, you have the full project installed. 3. To (finally) run the project, run `npm start`:

```js
// in the root folder of the project
npm start
```

You should get a message saying:

```js
Starting project at C:\...
```

**and a QR code.** Also a new tab should open on your browser showing the same QR code and other stuff. Now you can run the project on an Andorid or iOS emulator or even in your phone downloading the Expo Go App. Scan the QR code using the Expo Go App and see the magic happen!
